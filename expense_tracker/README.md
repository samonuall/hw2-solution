## Compile

To compile the code from terminal, use the following command:
```

```

You should be able to view the GUI of the project upon successful compilation. 

## Java Version

## Features
- Add a new transaction: First specify the amount and category. Then click on the Add transaction button. Adds the new transaction to the list and updates the total cost.
- Filter the transaction list by either amount or category: First specify the amount or category to be matched. Then click the corresponding Filter button. Highlights the matching transactions in the list.
